        "If you have ever had a conversation about digital marketing techniques, you’ve probably heard the term SEO tossed around. You might know that SEO is important and has something to do with search engines. But what exactly is SEO? In this article, we will explain SEO, why it is good for your business, and why you need it. SEO stands for Search Engine Optimization. In the simplest of terms, good SEO optimizes your visibility online. This means that the more people see your website, the more your online traffic increases, and the better your chances to provide your product or service to a greater number of people. Let’s break down why SEO is so important. Google search results display on an infinite scroll, meaning that new results populate as you continue scrolling down. While this means that your results might make it on to the first page (even if they’re the 100th result), the amount of clicks and impressions a webpage receives drop off substantially after the first 5-10 links. When you type in a Google search, how often do you venture down to the tenth or twentieth result? Chances are, you rarely have to because the first few options at the top—below the advertisements of course—contain the information you requested in your search query. If a prospective customer types in a topic relevant to what your business can provide, don’t you want to be on the top of that page alongside your competitors? If you aren’t, another business just gained a new customer—or, you just lost one. This is the importance of SEO for your business: SEO gives you the power to be the answer to potential customers’ questions. In addition to visibility and traffic increase, SEO contributes to your authoritative voice in your field. Authority then leads to brand trust, which ultimately leads to brand loyalty. When asking the question why is SEO good for business, the answer is that SEO not only attracts new customers but over time it also allows you to deepen your business’s relationship with those customers because of the trust you have established with them.",
